### 1.1. Grants
Conditioned on compliance with section 2, and subject to the reservations of section 1.2, you have the world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:

  a) Take any action with the Work or a Modified Work that would infringe the copyright or database protection laws of an Applicable Jurisdiction applying to the Work, including Publicly Performing any interface derived from the Work; and

  b) Take any action with the Work or a Modified Work that would infringe any patent claims Licensable by Licensor, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as distributed by Licensor.

### 1.2. Limitations on Grants
The permissions in Section 1.1 are the only permissions granted under this license. The following reservations apply:

  a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for Code that the Licensor has removed from the Work.

  b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service marks, or logos of

  c) Licensor, except to the extent necessary i) to comply with the attribution conditions in section 2.1 of this License; and ii) to describe a Modified Work as being compatible or not compatible with the Work.

## 2. Conditions
The following conditions apply to any exercise of the permissions given in section 1.

### 2.1. Attribution
You must a) retain all copyright, patent, or trademark notices contained in the Source Code, as well as any notices of licensing, authorship, or attribution, and b) provide all such notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the Software.

### 2.2. Licensed Distribution
#### 2.2.1. Distribution of the Work
With the exception in section 2.4, You must provide to each Recipient of the Work Access to Source Code corresponding to the Work provided.

#### 2.2.2. Distribution of a Modified Work
With the exception in section 2.4, You must provide to each Recipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to the Modified Work provided by You. The Source Code corresponding to the modifications in a Modified Work must be provided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a Compatible Open Source License.

### 2.3. Maintaining User Autonomy
You must give the same permissions received under this License to any Recipient, and You must refrain from using the permissions given under this License to interfere with any third party’s Possessory Interest in their own User Data. This includes:

  a) You may not, by means of cryptographic controls, technological protection measures, or any other method, limit a third party from independently Processing User Data in which they have a Possessory Interest;

  b) During the same period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under this License, You must also provide a copy of any User Data in your possession to a third party having a Possessory Interest in such User Data at no charge;

  c) You may not use the Software to control any cryptographic keys, seeds, or hashes pertaining to third parties where such control would prevent the third party from independently exercising the permissions granted under this License;

  d) You waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection measures that include use of the Work; and 

  e) You disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the Work as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

Other than the conditions requiring You to a) provide Recipients no-charge access to the Source Code of the Work or a Modified Work, and b) provide a copy at no charge of any User Data in Your possession to third parties having a Possessory Interest in the User Data, nothing in this License requires You to provide processing services to any Recipient or any other third party.

### 2.4. Combined Work Exception
As an exception to the conditions in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, any Source Code marked by the Licensor as having the “Combined Work Exception,” or any Object Code created from Source Code so marked, may be combined with other Software into a larger work, and the resulting larger work may be used, distributed, or sold under any other license, so long as You: a) comply with the notice conditions of section 2.1; b) comply with the distribution conditions of 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, relative to the Source Code provided to You; and c) comply with section 2.3.

## 3. Acceptance and Remedies
By taking any action that, absent this License, would infringe the intellectual property laws of an Applicable Jurisdiction, You are affirmatively agreeing to the conditions of this License. Any use of the Work outside the scope of this License infringes the rights of the Licensor and may be enforced via the intellectual property laws of the appropriate Jurisdiction. In addition, You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License, but You agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may enforce these conditions via specific performance.


## 4. Term and Termination
The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all applicable intellectual property rights expire, whichever comes first (“Term”). If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to You under section 1 by any Licensor automatically terminate. Otherwise, permissions granted to You under section 1 by any Licensor shall continue during the Term. You will immediately cease using and providing the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

### 4.1. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement
This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the conditions in section 2. As a special exception to termination for non-compliance, Your permissions under this License will be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of becoming aware of Your noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted under this License due to  either a) sustained noncompliance lasting more than sixty days, or b) subsequent termination for noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent.

### 4.2. Termination Due to Litigation
If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all permissions which have been validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, shall survive termination.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limits on Liability
### 5.1. Disclaimer of Warranty
The Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE WORK IS WITH YOU. This disclaimer is an essential part of this License. No license to the Work is granted except under this disclaimer.

### 5.2. Limitation of Liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.
